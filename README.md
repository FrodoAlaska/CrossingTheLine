# Game 1

Find your way through the treacherous highway in order to finally get a whiff of the beautiful and amazing drug that makes go insane. 

## General Structure 

The game has _15_ levels in total. The levels are split into threes. A group of 3 levels is more like a _chapter_ or a _world_ if you will. Every chapter has a new mechanic to introduce, starting out in the first level and then being tested throughout the next 2 levels with all the other mechanics introduced in previous levels. The last 3 levels (13 through 15) are "special" levels that only exist to close the final story of the game. They aren't really challenging, per se. They are more abstract than anything. Actually, they are the easiest levels in the entire game. This means that we have about _4_ mechanics (12 levels / 3 levels in a chapter) to introduce per chapter and use throughout the game. There is more information about each mechanic below. 

Besides that, every after every chapter, we have a "story slide". A simple faded in text that gives more background about the character. They are very short and only talk about an idea from an abstracted sense. They are intentioally left ambigious. Generally these story slides do discuss addiction, but not much more in depth information about who the character is and why he went into this spiral in the first place. However, in these story slides, there is also a golden question mark at the end, hinting at a more "complete" version of the story. In order to unlock these secret story sections, the player has to collect three collictables. They could be coins, pipes, or something else. I don't know yet. The most important thing is that they are golden. If the player collects all these collectibales in the chapter, they can unlock a more in-depth look at who the character is and what made him go down this path. 

The story is about suicide, about not letting go of the past, and about heartbreak. I know. Very original.

## Mechanics

Since there are only 4 mechanics to work with, I need to make it count. And in order to give myself a bit of leg room, the cars themselves and single-lane roads are _not_ considered "mechanics". They are _core_ features of the game. However, despite that, there might be more ideas that I will cook up. Or maybe some of the ideas below turn out to be shit and I'll decided to remove them. Either way, here they are listed in order of appearance and their use cases. 

- Multi-lane roads: This can be used to have more challenging sections in the game where the player either has to sprint and hope for the best or time it just right. It will be very hard especially when combined with other mechanics in this game. I have _a lot_ of ideas about how this mechanic can be put to use. 

- Bi-directional velocities: Initially, the cars will only drive in on way. Either this way or that way. All cars will have the same direction, essentially. However, with this mechanic, cars in seperate lanes can have seperate direcitons. So you actually have to look to your left and to your right. This combined with the multi-lane mechanic can produce some _very_ fun levels.

- Trucks: Unlike regular cars which are fast and genrally take one lane in the road, trucks are _slow_ and _huge_. A single truck can take whole _two_ lanes in the road. Maybe a truck can be combined with a fast moving car in a triple-lane road, forcing the player to make a strategic plan. Even better, we can combine the bi-directional mechanic with the multi-lane mechanic to produce and bi-directional trucks that are very slow. Perhaps even add a car in the middle. 

- Bikes: While cars and trucks are a danger to the player, they are only dangerous when on the road. Generally, the player is safe when he's on the sidewalk... right? Well, yes. Sometimes. In a few instances, there are annoying bike riders who think that they are in the olympics. They will whizz through you and trample you without even looking. Basically, they will circle around the sidewalk back and forth with somewhat of a slow pace. So the player will have to focus on both the roads _and_ the sidewalk. Is it annoying? Is it okay? I'm not really sure. Test it.

### Potential mechanics 

Besides the mechanics above that I'm pretty confident about, here are a few others that might or might not make the cut. 

- Road blocks:
