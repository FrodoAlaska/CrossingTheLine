## Crossing The Line

Find your way through the treacherous highway in order to finally save yourself from your own mind and past.

As the player, you are tasked with crossing the treacherous levels, evading all the vehicles that are coming your way. The cars don't care about you and perhaps don't even see you. Try to collect the keys to advance through the games, and witness a man descending into madness as he tries to come to terms with the past.

## Controls 

Use the **WASD** keys to move the player through the various roads. The **ENTER** key is used as an interactive key for starting a level and/or selecting an option from the menu. The **Arrow keys** are used to navigate through the options of the menus.

## Dependencies 

- [Nikola Game Engine](https://github.com/FrodoAlaska/Nikola.git)

## Build Instructions

This game uses _CMake_ for the build process. Running the command below in sequence will clone the game, generate the necessary build files, and compile the project.

```
git clone https://github.com/FrodoAlaska/CrossingTheLine.git

mkdir build && cd build
cmake ..
cmake --build .
```

Be prepared to wait for a while since the game fetches all its dependencies and builds them as well. However, after the compilation process is complete, you can play the game right away if you have the necessary assets for the game.
