## Crossing The Line

Find your way through the treacherous highway in order to finally save yourself from your own mind and past.

As the player, you are tasked with crossing the treacherous levels, evading all the vehicles that are coming your way. The cars don't care about you and perhaps don't even see you. Try to collect the keys to advance through the games, and witness a man descending into madness as he tries to come to terms with the past.
