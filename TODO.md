# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Core mechanic/game loop: 
    - Polish a bit. Not all, but a few.
    - Design, create, and test Chapter 2 
    - Save progress. Keys collected, levels completed, time played?
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.
    
- Polish points: 
    - Slightly better movements (player falling down, footstep detection, etc)
    - Controller support
    - Some kind of credits scene?
    - Fog 
    - Particles

- Get some assets:
    - Some 3D model to represent the end point of the level and even the start of the chapter.
    - Sounds for footsteps on paviment and the road 
    - Sound for fail input for trying to access a chapter that is unreachable 

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now.
