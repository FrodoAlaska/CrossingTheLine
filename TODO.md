# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Core mechanic/game loop: 
    - Save progress. Keys collected, levels completed, time played?
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.

- Polish points: 
    - Better state code structure
    - Improved credits scene
    - Settings UI (leave this to the end)

## Fixes 

- The player should not die in the hub world

# Road To The End 

- Design, create, and test Chapter 2
