# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.
    - Polish the distribution build

- Polish points: 
    - The physics needs work. The player goes through the floor way too many times. 
        - Make the player a dynamic body 
        - Hang the player's collider a little lower 
        - Keep the current movement
        - (That way there will be collision detection and resolution with the kinematic movement)
    - Polish the dialogue

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now
