# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.
    - Polish the distribution build

- Polish points: 
    - Resolve the player falling through the ground
    - Some paviments need to be lowered a bit

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now
