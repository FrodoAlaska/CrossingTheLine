# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.

- Polish points: 
    - Fog and all that entails...
    - Settings UI (leave this to the end)
    - The physics needs work. The player goes through the floor way too many times. 
     - Make the player a dynamic body 
     - Hang the player's collider a little lower 
     - Keep the current movement
     - (That way there will be collision detection and resolution with the kinematic movement)

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now
