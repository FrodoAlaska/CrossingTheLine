# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Rebuild the hub to alleviate for the extra chapter 
    - Design, create, and playtest Chapter 4
    - Save progress. Keys collected, levels completed, time played?
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.

- Polish points: 
    - The physics needs work. The player goes through the floor way too many times. 
    - Rethink the fog or something that would obfuscate the player's vision a bit
    - The dialogue needs to be seperated into chapters in the code rather than willy-nilly
    - Improved credits scene. It's a bit weird for some reason.
    - Settings UI (leave this to the end)

## Fixes 

- The player should not die in the hub world
