# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Core mechanic/game loop: 
    - A hub world.
    - Decide on what to have to hide the end points of the car and what will be the "object" that will signify the end point (a cone? a literal line?).

- Polish points: 
    - Pause menu?
    - Fix the text placing. Some texts with bigger font sizes have weird widths.
    - UI navigation 
    - Add the story through the UI. Some little things here and there on the end menus and maybe something that pops up when you pickup the keys.
    - Fog 
    - Smooth transition between states 
    - UI sounds 
    - Slightly better movements

- Get some art:
    - Truck 
    - Arch to hide to car end points 
    - etc...

- Get some test sounds and attach them to audio sources for the cars.

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now.
