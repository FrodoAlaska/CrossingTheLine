# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Polish a bit more
    - Rebuild the hub to alleviate for the extra chapter 
    - Save progress. Keys collected, levels completed, time played?
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.

- Polish points: 
    - Improve the story thingy at the end? Better visualization? Inside a box maybe?
    - Make the key standout more.
    - Improved credits scene
    - Settings UI (leave this to the end)

## Fixes 

- The player should not die in the hub world
