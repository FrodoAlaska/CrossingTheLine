# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- UI system

- Cool menu screen

- Menu system

- A better and improved system to switch between levels. Nothing too fancy or final. Just the foundation.

- Improved HUD.

- Find a way to prevent the player from going outside of the level. Some road blocks on the edges? Invisible blocks? Anything to prevent the player from leaving the area and falling to their depths. 

- Try to polish the first 5 levels until we are sure everything is good. Because if we move to the next few levels, we at least have a standard and a process. It's essentially going to all be about the level design and not much about the implementation of certain 
game mechanics.

- Get some art:
    - Truck 
    - etc...

- Get some test sounds and attach them to audio sources for the cars.
