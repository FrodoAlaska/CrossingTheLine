# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Core mechanic/game loop: 
    - Decide on what to have to hide the end points of the car and what will be the "object" that will signify the end point (a cone? a literal line?).
    - Re-structure the code because oh my god, what the hell??!!!
    - Polish a bit. Not all, but a few.
    - Save the keys collected

- Polish points: 
    - Fog 
    - Slightly better movements
    - Controller support
    - Fix the text placing. Some texts with bigger font sizes have weird widths.
    - UI sounds 
    - Add the story through the UI. Some little things here and there on the end menus and maybe something that pops up when you pickup the keys.
    - Particles
    - Don't play the ambiance sound in the hub world

- Get some assets:
    - Truck 
    - Arch to hide to car end points 
    - etc...

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now.
