# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Find a way to prevent the player from going outside of the level. Some road blocks on the edges? Invisible blocks? Anything to prevent the player from leaving the area and falling to their depths. 

- Make the last level of each chapter a "special" boy level, where the player will have to go up to a podium or a cone(?) or something else, interact with it, and get a few texts poping up, informing the player of the actual story. After which, the player can move on to the next chapter. 

- Try to polish the first 5 levels until we are sure everything is good. Because if we move to the next few levels, we at least have a standard and a process. It's essentially going to all be about the level design and not much about the implementation of certain 
game mechanics.

- Polish points: 
    - Pause menu?
    - Fix the text placing. Some texts with bigger font sizes have weird widths.
    - UI navigation 
    - Fog 
    - Smooth transition between states 
    - UI sounds 
    - Slightly better movements

- Get some art:
    - Truck 
    - etc...

- Get some test sounds and attach them to audio sources for the cars.
