# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.
    - Polish the distribution build

- Polish points: 
    - Resolve the player falling through the ground
    - Polish the dialogue
        - Some words are too big even for the wrap. You need to wrap early for them specifically 
        - The actual writing 

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now
