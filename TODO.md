# Road to MVP (Minimal Viable Product) 

- Immediate:
    - Save progress. Keys collected, levels completed, time played?
    - Save the dialogue in a binary file instead of a text file for the dist build.

- Polish points: 
    - Improved credits scene.
    - Tunnels and all that entails...
    - The physics needs work. The player goes through the floor way too many times. 
    - Settings UI (leave this to the end)

## Fixes 

- Empty... for now
